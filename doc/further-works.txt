Further Works

The introductory section on the main page is rather "scrappy" especially
at around width 1250px, this could do with redesigning.

The crocodile picture zoom is off-balance, find a way of making it centered
on the column.

The habitat animal pages could do with 8 or 9 pictures rather than 6,
with the smaller images appearing at the top of the page for a better
effect.

The Human Concerns section could do with more detail and be set on
its own page.
