## Suggestions:
	1. Background Information on Current Climate Forecasting
		Rejected on the grounds of difficulty in obtaining copyright
		permissions.

	Since this issue could arise with any number of projects arising from
	internet data, it is better to chose a project which uses all freely
	available information and then to collate it into a single project,
	in order to provide a novel perspective.

	One very wide source of information is Wikipedia - what are its
	copyright rules? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About
	"To remain, the content must be free of copyright".
	This implies quite clearly that we can freely use Wikipedia material.
	We could use this data to satisfy the climate forecasting issue, however
	the problem in this case would potentially be bias (requirement for
	multiple sources).

	So the issue here is to synthesise a new perspective based on Wikipedia
	data.

	2. Snapshot of Animals of the Democratic Republic of the Congo

## Background Information on Current Climate Forecasting, a Website Summary

### Audience
	For those interested in filling-in some of the missing-links in their
	understanding of current climate concerns.

### Information Content and Strategy
	The website should not be more than 5 pages.
	The time budget is 4 weeks.
	Graphics, rather than text should be used where possible.

	The questions answered should be
		What are the current forecasts?
		How is the information gathered and what data is used?
		By whom and how is the information processed?
		How are problems arising being ameliorated?
	
	The time budget for gathering and processing information
	is 1 week.
	The source for information should be the internet.
	Information gathered should be condensed into a manageable
	summary.

	A factor to take into consideration is plagiarism, who needs
	to be notified/asked to allow the use of information? Can this
	be arranged in project time? This is a crucial point for this 
	project suggestion, it is not likely that permission would be
	refused, but simply that it is unlikely to be agreed in time.

	Reliability - how do we ensure the reliability of information?

## Snapshot of Animals of the Democratic Republic of the Congo

### Audience
	Anyone interested in nature, geography and natural preservation

### Aims
	To collate information on larger animals and their habitats in the Congo.
	To provide the user with a summarised snapshot of species present and
	the current state of affairs and to provide links for further human
	interest.

### Strategy and Content
#### Information Sources
	Wikipedia: Congo, Congo Tourism/Charities etc., 
	Wildlife of the Democratic Republic of Congo and it's links.

#### Areas of Interest and Associated Information
	The aim of the website is to provide brief descriptions of
	a set of animals in their contexts, to convey a sense of their
	relations to human activity and to provide the user with
	further information to connect with these issues. Therefore
	the broad information headings are:

		Congo Geography
		Congo Habitats
			Animals within those habitats (3)
		Human interaction with the habitats
		The Political Situation, Tourism and Interested Organisations

	We will assume for now that this will require 7 pages

#### Time Allocations and Priorities
	Allowing four man weeks (48 1/2 day units) for the project, we have the following
	stages:
		1. Information gathering and collation/condensation
		2. Page designs allowing for conformance/UXD 
		3. Page development
		4. Page testing and project release

		Allowing 6 units per page for development 42 units in all, then we can see 
		already, that this is likely to be too ambitious for the time allocated.

#### Retrenchments and Scope
	Since we must in any event, gather and collate the information, let us allocate
	8 time units to this. This leaves us 40 units for the other stages. Allow 1 unit 
	for site design, 2 units for each page design, 6 units each for development, 
	1 unit each for testing, 1 unit for the README.md layout.
	This only allows for 4 pages, so we must either modify our aims or condense
	still further.

	The PRIMARY aim, as given in the title, is to provide a snapshot of the animals
	and their habitats for general interest.

	So let us condense the Human Concerns and Habitats on to the main Geography page
	as links to other sources and paragraphs of text. This still serves the
	user as an information source on these areas of further interest. We need
	to be selective because of the risk of making the page too busy.

	To allow for future expansion of the site in an orderly way, the webpage connections
	should be heirarchical for the habitats, we might later divide them into
	birds, reptiles, mammals, fish etc. The human concerns could then be lateral
	on the menu.
