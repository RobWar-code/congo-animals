## Suggestions:
	1. Background Information on Current Climate Forecasting
		Rejected on the grounds of difficulty in obtaining copyright
		permissions.

	Since this issue could arise with any number of projects arising from
	internet data, it is better to chose a project which uses all freely
	available information and then to collate it into a single project,
	in order to provide a novel perspective.

	One very wide source of information is Wikipedia - what are its
	copyright rules? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About
	"To remain, the content must be free of copyright".
	This implies quite clearly that we can freely use Wikipedia material.
	We could use this data to satisfy the climate forecasting issue, however
	the problem in this case would potentially be bias (requirement for
	multiple sources).

	So the issue here is to synthesise a new perspective based on Wikipedia
	data.

	2. Snapshot of Animals of the Democratic Republic of the Congo

## Background Information on Current Climate Forecasting, a Website Summary

### Audience
	For those interested in filling-in some of the missing-links in their
	understanding of current climate concerns.

### Information Content and Strategy
	The website should not be more than 5 pages.
	The time budget is 4 weeks.
	Graphics, rather than text should be used where possible.

	The questions answered should be
		What are the current forecasts?
		How is the information gathered and what data is used?
		By whom and how is the information processed?
		How are problems arising being ameliorated?
	
	The time budget for gathering and processing information
	is 1 week.
	The source for information should be the internet.
	Information gathered should be condensed into a manageable
	summary.

	A factor to take into consideration is plagiarism, who needs
	to be notified/asked to allow the use of information? Can this
	be arranged in project time? This is a crucial point for this 
	project suggestion, it is not likely that permission would be
	refused, but simply that it is unlikely to be agreed in time.

	Reliability - how do we ensure the reliability of information?
