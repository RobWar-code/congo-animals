Bonobo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo

Bonobos are closely related to chimpanzees, from which they are separated
by the Congo river. A bonobo is from 70 to 83cm long from nose to rump when on
all fours. Females are slightly smaller than males. Bonobo males weigh an average
of 45kg, whilst females weigh an average 33kg. Bonobos are omnivorous frugivores,
about 57% of their diet is fruit. The animals live in matriarchal social groups
which are nomadic, rather than territorial.
