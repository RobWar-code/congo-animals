Forest
    The Congolian Rainforest is the world's second-largest rainforest after the 
    Amazon rainforest. It has an area of about 2,000,000 sq. km. It extends
    across six African countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
    through which, its primary river, the Congo, flows. It consists of broadleaf
    trees and is the only forest known to adsorb more carbon dioxide than it
    produces.

Savanna
    The savanna of the Democratic Republic of Congo is a forest-savanna mosaic.
    This is a transitional region between the rainforest and the much drier
    savannas. It has grasslands as well as areas of broadleaf forest. It is
    subject to seasonal greening as opposed to the evergreen nature of the
    rainforest.

    It is flat, wet forest at altitude 300 - 400 mtrs. It covers an area of about
    92,000 sq. km. It has not been extensively researched, but is known to be home 
    to diverse species.
