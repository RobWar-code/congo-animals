African dwarf frogs can grow to about 7.5cm long and weigh a few grams. They
are completely aquatic. They scavenge for their food and will eat anything from 
decaying organic matter to living creatures, depending on what they can ingest.
They can use their webbed feet to shove food into their mouths.
